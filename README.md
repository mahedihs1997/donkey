This project is measure my progress over the last year since I finished my uni project: https://github.com/mahedihs1997/Garits. I was trying to learn new technologies and improve my current skills, and thought it would be a good idea to implement the same project with a different tech stack. GARITS (uni project), was built using Java for desktop with a local database. This project consists of two parts - Frontend built with Next Js & Apollo, and backend built with Firebase & Apollo Server.
